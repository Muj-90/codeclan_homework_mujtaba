I want to predict how well 6 year-olds are going to do in their final school exams. Using the following variables am I likely under-fitting, fitting well or over-fitting? Postcode, gender, reading level, score in maths test, date of birth, family income.






2 - If I have two models, one with an AIC score of 34,902 and the other with an AIC score of 33,559 which model should I use?
  
The better AIC is 33,559 




3- I have two models, the first with: r-squared: 0.44, adjusted r-squared: 0.43. The second with: r-squared: 0.47, adjusted r-squared: 0.41. Which one should I use?
  i will use r-squared: 0.44, adjusted r-squared: 0.43.




4- I have a model with the following errors: RMSE error on test set: 10.3, RMSE error on training data: 10.4. Do you think this model is over-fitting?
